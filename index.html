          This isn't about understanding. Understanding is too slow. You navigate instead through fragments, through gestures, through echoes of what was, knowing that what was is already gone.

          There is no static ground, no fixed perspective. The system bends around you, accommodating your presence while erasing its edges. It makes room, but not for you, only for the continuation of itself. Its logic is recursive, self-sustaining, indifferent to the meaning you try to extract from it.<br><br>

          It isn't an escape, and it isn't a tool. It’s an extension of everything we are, amplified and abstracted, mirrored and distorted. It’s a system that changes as you move through it, adapting faster than you can process. It doesn't stop, and neither do you.
